                Brighton is located directly in the path of winter storms and it is also at
                the very top of Big Cottonwood Canyon so it gets the very best of the 
                “greatest snow on earth,” and lots of it. The mountain averages 500 inches
                of snow a winter. The snow is traditionally light, fluffy and dry making it
                a paradise for riders and skiers. Most skiers and riders stick to the immaculately
                groomed trails, but there are trees and chutes, cliffs and natural terrain 
                parks all within bounds for those who like white knuckle terrain. Freestyle riders
                and skiers enjoy Brighton’s four terrain parks for all abilities. The terrain
                park crew keeps moving the features around so what’s here today might be gone
                tomorrow. The challenge keeps changing. And there’s Night skiing. Brigthon has
                the most night skiing terrain in Utah with 22 runs on over 200 lighted acres.

                Brighton is famous for its Ski and Snowboard School. It is known as
                “The place where Utah learns to ski and ride and keeps on learning.”
                It has earned that reputation because of its consistent dedication
                to the students. Brighton’s Ski and Snowboard School has private
                lessons, daily group classes for every ability level of skiers and
                riders, and specialty series for kids, women, seniors, and much more.

                Solitude Resort is located in Big Cottonwood Canyon, just below
                Brighton Resort. Solitude has something to offer skiers and riders
                of all abilities with an average of 500" of annual snowfall, 1,200
                acres of terrain, 77 named runs, and three bowls. The Snowsports
                Academy provides lessons and clinics for guests of all ages. The
                Nordic Center is an option for non-downhill skiers or snowboarders,
                where you can enjoy Nordic skiing or snowshoeing. Solitude is known
                for its easy-going atmosphere and loose feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solitude is divided into two distinct areas from which to begin 
                your mountain adventures—the Moonbeam and Village base areas.
                Moonbeam generally services day skiers and riders while the Village
                area is home to most of the resort’s lodging guests. The Village 
                base is home to a kid-friendly ice skating rink to keep the winter
                fun going after the lifts shut down.

                the most popular ski resort within the State of Utah. It is one of the bigger ski resorts
                in Salt Lake City. Snowbird has 15 lifts and 1 tram. There are about 169 runs on the 
                entire mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Snowbird also has several lodges and hotels for tourists. The lodges are very
                luxurious and all are on the mountain. It also offers snowmobiling and
                heli-skiing.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the 2015/16 season, Snowbird is introducing over $35 million 
                in resort improvements, all designed to enhance the guest experience.
                Upgrades include The Summit at Snowbird, a renovated Cliff Lodge,
                increased snowmaking and RFID/smartcard passes. The Summit, a new
                facility at the top of the iconic Aerial Tram, features dining, 
                retail, guest services and unmatched views of the Wasatch Mountains.

                No Snowboarders Permitted! Alta is the only skiers only resort. 
                There is a spirit to Alta. Perhaps it is because generations of 
                skiers have been able to pass on their love for the mountain to 
                family and friends. Alta is located in Little Cottonwood Canyon above 
                Snowbird Resort. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Alta was the first ski area in Utah to install a lift, two years 
                behind Sun Valley, Idaho’s installation in 1936. Alta grew slowly,
                building new lifts as the numbers of skiers grew and working with 
                businesses in the area to provide day shelters and eventually lodging.

                Alta has been referred to as a “skier’s mountain” for many reasons.
                It is known for its scenery, diverse terrain and for the uncanny 
                quality of snow that it receives season after season. Also, Alta 
                does not allow other types of winter recreation other than skiing. 
                It is a watershed, so no mechanized vehicles are allowed.

                Located in the heart of Park City, Utah, only a 35-minute drive 
                from Salt Lake City International Airport, Park City is home to 
                over 7,300 skiable acres with a good mix of beginner, intermediate
                and advanced terrain. During Summer 2015, the Resort undertook 
                the largest resort improvement project in the history of American 
                skiing, one that linked it with neighbor Canyons Resort to create
                the United States’ largest ski area. Park City bustles with 
                activities year-round with three distinct base areas, nine hotels,
                thrilling family adventures, and more than two dozen restaurants.

                Park City is the largest ski area in the United States. With 
                over 7,300 acres, 300+ trails, 38 lifts, seven terrain parks, 
                14 bowls, six natural half pipes, one super pipe and one mini 
                pipe, plus many diverse ski-in/ski-out and village adjacent 
                lodging properties, Park City is an easily accessible, world-class
                mountain destination located in an authentic & historic western town.
