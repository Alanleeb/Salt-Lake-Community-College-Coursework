        <p>"Aaron was the hardest working and greatest employee I ever had. He was always
            willing to work and even asked for more work. He took initiative and that's
            what you need in an employee. I recommend Aaron for any job. He can help
            in any way possible."

            "Aaron has been my most loyal employee. He is always working and never slacks off.
            He has aided me in my work as an attorney and has a great mind for law.
            He always finishes the assignments I give him in a timely manner and does it without 
            complaining. He is also a solution finder. He is always finding and thinking
            of new and more efficient ways to work. He is a great worker and would
            be a great employee to any company"
